2016-03-16  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved circular NTA rewrite implementation: implicit rewrite
    attributes are now generated only for node types that have a rewrite, and
    the attribute relies on the rewrite condition to decide when the rewrite
    has reached a final result.
    * Removed list rewrites. List rewrites were an undocumented feature that
    caused problems for attribute correctness by allowing nodes to change
    position in a list after the AST was constructed.
    * Removed staged rewrites. Rewrite stages were an undocumented,
    unsupported, and mostly unused feature. Removing staged rewrites
    simplifies code generation.
    * Rewrites no longer trigger on child count access.

    Removed list rewrites. Removed rewrite limit. Removed staged rewrites.

2016-02-02  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed repeated error message reported for multiple production rules for
    a single nonterminal in the abstract grammar.

2016-01-17  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added generated methods ASTNode.astChildren() and
    ASTNode.astChildIterator() for easier iteration over the AST, but without
    implmenting java.lang.Iterable on ASTNode.

2016-01-11  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * When a contribution uses the `each` keyword before the value expression,
    the value is treated as an iterable object. The value object is iterated
    and each element in the value is added to the attribute value.
    * Removed an undocumented feature that allowed multiple value expressions
    for a single contribution statement.

2015-12-27  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * The initial expression for a collection attribute is now
    optional. If no expression is given, the default
    initialization is calling the default constructor of the
    collection attribute type. This only works when the
    attribute type is a concrete type with an accessible
    default constructor.

2015-12-17  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed java.lang.Iterable from the list of implemented interfaces for
    the default ASTNode.
    * Added support for nested generic classes/interfaces in aspect-declared
    classes/interfaces.

2015-12-04  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd now always starts a new circular evaluation if a circular
    attribute is called by a cached attribute that in turn was called by
    another circular evaluation. This ensures correct caching behaviour for
    the lazy attribute by avoiding caching an intermediate circular value,
    but it can cause incorrectly specified circular attributes to behave
    differently.

    Cached attribute checking for circular evaluation used to be part of the
    --componentCheck flag, so part of the original purpose of --componentCheck
    is now removed, but the flag can still be used to generate code that
    throws a runtime exception whenever a non-circular attribute is found to
    be effectively circular.

2015-11-19  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added separate survey method to start collecting contributors for
    collection attributes.

2015-11-18  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved error messages from collection contributions for undeclared
    collection attributes. The attribute name is now included in the error
    message, not just the host type.

2015-11-17  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Added generated attribute ASTNodeAnnotation.Source for attributes.
    * Added command line flag --generateAnnotations (default=true)

2015-11-16  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Added more information to the generated annotation
      @ASTNodeAnnotation.Attribute:
        Kind: SYN|INH|COLL
        isNTA: true|false
        isCircular: true|false

2015-11-06  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed error in the collection attribute runtime debug check (when trying
    to evaluate a collection attribute in subtree not attached to main tree).
    * Renamed the hidden inherited attribute parameters "child" and "caller"
    to "_childNode" and "_callerNode" in order to reduce the likelyhood of
    name clashes with the formal attribute parameters.
    * Removed @SeparateEvaluation annotation for collection attributes - this
    code generation annotation did not since many version back.

2015-11-03  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * The 'with x' part of collection attribute declarations is now optional.
    * The 'with' and 'root' keywords are now treated as keywords and must be
    spelled correctly in collection attribute declarations.

2015-10-16  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Inherited attributes are now evaluated iteratively. This reduces the
    stack height when evaluating inherited attributes in large trees.
    * Re-enabled collection attribute annotations @OnePhase,
    @SeparateEvaluation, @LazyCondition, @Circular, @CollectionGroup, and
    @Naive.

2015-09-02  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed documentation comment generation for synthesized attribute
    equations.
    * Removed package declaration support in the aspect file parser. This was
    an unused feature that did not affect the code generation.
    * Support the Java 7 diamond construct in aspect files.

2015-09-01  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved inherited attribute support with respect to synthesized NTAs.

2015-05-13  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added option --StateClassName, to allow changing the name of ASTNode$State
    * The default name for ASTNode$State is no longer affected by
    the --ASTNode option.
    * The fullCopy method is now annotated with @Deprecated (in addition to
    the JavaDoc annotation)

2015-03-17  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Generate declared-at comments inside inherited attribute evaluator
    methods.

2015-02-26  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed unused generated code for rewrite state tracking: duringXYZ
    field in ASTNode$State and corresponding method in ASTNode.

2015-02-25  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Made ASTNode.state private. This field is used internally in generated
    code for attribute circularity checks and other purposes and should not be
    accessed by non-generated code. Making this field private reduces the
    risk of inadvertently using it.

2015-02-19  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed remaining Java 1.4 support. Some code generation templates were
    still affected by the Java 1.4 option.
    * Simplified generated code by removing redundant boxing/unboxing of
    cache values.
    * Improved code generation - avoid generating empty finally blocks for
    some synthesized attributes.

2015-02-05  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed multi-level inheritance of collection attribute declaration
    interface inheritance.

2015-02-02  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved generated inherited attribute code layout.
    * The Java 1.4 option has been disabled. If Java 1.4 execution is
    required then a third-party translator can be used, such as
    Retrotranslator (http://retrotranslator.sourceforge.net/)

2015-01-30  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed inherited attribute return type from Define_XXX method name.

2015-01-27  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added --generateimplicits={true,false} option

2015-01-26  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * It is now possible to use JastAdd keywords such as "syn", "eq" and "inh"
    as regular Java identifiers in certain Java code contexts like attribute
    equations or method bodies.

2015-01-23  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed a declaration order dependence between interface declarations
    and synthesized attributes

2015-01-22  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Calling a child set-method for an NTA child now throws an exception

2015-01-20  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Setters are no longer generated for NTA children

2015-01-16  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed redundant/incorrect cache check for NTA attributes
    * NTAs using the nta keyword on the equation now store their value in the
      child vector even if the component NTA was also declared in the grammar

2015-01-12  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added the rewrite=true option again! It was unintentionally removed during
      option refactoring.

2014-12-13  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Sort options by name in help output.

2014-12-11  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added error message for unknown collection root errors.

2014-12-10  Görel Hedin <gorel.hedin@cs.lth.se>

    * Added --ASTNodeSuper option to set a custom superclass of ASTNode.

2014-11-25  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Added support for wildcard in parameter type for parameterized attributes

2014-11-25  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Command-line options with argument values must now always use the form
    --argument=value
    * Unknown command-line options are now reported as errors

2014-10-13  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added --dot option, which generates a class diagram for the input
    grammar

2014-09-23  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed regression introduced in 2.1.9 for collection attributes declared
      on interfaces. (Compile-time error in generated Java code)

2014-09-01  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Release 2.1.9

2014-09-01  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Deprecated options:

        - doc (unused)
        - java1.4 (not tested)
        - noLazyMaps (equivalent to lazyMaps=false)
        - noVisitCheck (equivalent to visitCheck=flase)
        - noCacheCycle (equivalent to cacheCycle=false)
        - noRefineLegacy (equivalent to refineLegacy=false)
        - noComponentCheck (componentCheck was already off by default)
        - noInhEqCheck (equivalent to inhEqCheck=false)
        - noStatic (the name was misleading, renamed to staticState)
        - deterministic (collection attributes are now always deterministic)

    * New or updated options:

        + staticState (replaces noStatic)
        + incremental: added 'none' option (this is the default value)

    * Code generation changes

        - Don't generate ASTNode$State.IdentityHashSet

    * Template variable chnages:

        * removed Deterministic (no longer relevant)
        * removed CircularEnabled (was always enabled)
        * removed NoStatic
        * added StaticState (replaces NoStatic)

    * Improved JastAddTask. Should now be closer to the command-line interface.

2014-08-28  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Missing inherited equations are no longer reported for inherited
    attributes declared on root nodes.

2014-08-06  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Subtypes of List and Opt are no longer root node candidates

2014-08-05  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Allow inherited attributes only declared on List or Opt

2014-08-01  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed error where a cloned node would not be able to be rewritten.

2014-07-29  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Aspect top-level enum declarations are now supported.
    * Interface declarations nested in a class declaration should no longer
      cause JastAdd to generate a top-level interface with the same name.
    * Removed aspect extends and implements constructs that were
      never used.

2014-07-27  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Deprecated the --deterministic option
    * LinkedList is used for collection contributor sets now, which
      should improve performance slightly

2014-07-24  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd2 now handles generic method inter-type declarations such
    as `public <T> void A.m()`

2014-07-02  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed indirect call to flushRewriteCache from clone.
    This caused a bug when rewrites, flush, and treeCopy were used together.

2014-06-05  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Delay processing of inter-type declarations until after parsing all
    Jrag specification files. This allows aspect-declared classes to be
    parsed after inter-type declarations that weave objects into them.
    * Removed obsolete aspect "sons" declaration
    * JastAdd no longer strips modifiers from aspect interface declarations
    * JastAdd no longer removes static or adds public modifier to aspect
    class declarations

2014-02-28  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Build script now handles absence of git a bit better.

2014-01-31  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed regression introduced in 2.1.6 which caused circular collection
    attributes to crash JastAdd.

2014-01-10  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd now generates annotations for children, tokens and attributes
    (@Child, @ListChild, @OptChild, @Token, @Attribute).

2014-01-10  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed comment parsing error where documentation comments nested in
    single-line comments were incorrectly parsed

2014-01-07  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd now reports an error if rewrites are used in an aspect while
    rewrites are not enabled

2014-01-03  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Report parse errors for generated aspects (they were ignored before).

2013-12-03  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Added the abstract methods fullCopy(), treeCopyNoTransform() and 
    treeCopy() to abstract classes (with correct return type).

2013-10-30  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd now inlines all equation compute methods where the equation
    is a single Java expression.

2013-10-18  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed potential crash during refinement processing

2013-10-15  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Implemented alternative inherited equation checking analysis
    that runs quicker on grammars with many inherited attributes

2013-10-08  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd warns if there is no root node in the grammar

2013-10-08  Emma Söderberg <emma.soderberg@cs.lth.se>

   * JastAdd now supports a flush flag which allows for configuring of
   flushing.  The flag takes the following values
   'attr','coll'.'rewrite','full'. Default is 'attr' and 'coll'. The 'rewrite'
   value makes flushing of outermost rewrites possible by storing their
   initial values. The 'full' value includes all values.
   * The default flushing API provided by JastAdd has been extended with a
   flushTreeCache method calling flushCache and traversing the tree. A call to
   this method together with the use of the flush='full' will result in a full
   flush of an AST.
   * Attributes are flushed via separate reset methods, one per cache
   attribute.
   * All cached attributes in a node are flushed from a flushAttrCache method
   which is called from flushCache.
   * Rewrites are flushed from a flushRewriteCache method which is called from
   flushCache.

2013-10-02  Emma Söderberg <emma.soderberg@cs.lth.se>

   * Added treeCopyNoTransform to replace fullCopy
   * Deprecated fullCopy
   * Added doFullTraversal method on ASTNode which uses getChild to traverse
   and trigger rewrites
   * Added treeCopy which traverses using doFullTraversal before calling
   treeCopyNoTransform

2013-10-01  Emma Söderberg <emma.soderberg@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd now generates the Tracer class for the --tracing option as a
    nested class in ASTNode$State and provides a trace access method called
    'trace' available via the state object.

2013-09-20  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd now reports a warning if multiple values are given to an option
    that only accepts one value argument

2013-09-17  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Undeprecated the --visitCheck option (will replace --noVisitCheck in the
    future by adding a boolean argument)
    * Undeprecated the --cacheCycle option (will replace --noCacheCycle in the
    future by adding boolean argument)

2013-09-16  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * jastadd.JastAddTask prints deprecation warning when used
    * All JastAddTask options are passed through the central Configuration
    class so that all options are handled in a uniform way

2013-09-15  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * An error is now reported if no grammar files are given on the command
    line.
    * If any error prevents JastAdd from running, a short line will be printed
    with info about obtaining help (--help), rather than the full help output.
    This makes it easier to spot the error message on the command line.
    * Refactored option handling.
    * All JastAdd configuration options are now stored in
    org.jastadd.Configuration.

2013-09-11  Emma Söderberg <emma.soderberg@cs.lth.se>

    * Added support for --cache=analyze
      This argument to cache will enable full caching and
      tracing of cache events, and it generates a CacheAnalyzer
      class which is registered as an input filter in the Tracer class.

2013-09-10  Emma Söderberg <emma.soderberg@cs.lth.se>

    * Changed cache configuration flags. The new flag is called "cache" and
      takes one of "all","none","config", or "implicit" as argument.
    * Deprecated old cache configuration flags: "cacheAll", "cacheNone",
      "cacheImplicit", and "ignoreLazy". The first three deprecated flags
      can be given on a new format with the new flag. The last deprecated flag
      ("ignoreLazy") has no direct mapping, but all options with the new
      flag are intended to ignore the 'lazy' configuration.

2013-09-10  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Changed tracing flag to enable static filtering of tracing, e.g.,
    --tracing=compute will only trace compute events. The new tracing flags are:
    compute,cache,rewrite,circularNTA,circular,copy. These can be combined,
    e.g., --tracing=compute,cache . The flag --tracing will enable tracing of
    all trace events (as before).
    * Added abstract class InputFilter to tracing that can be used to control
    how tracing objects are created (e.g., to save memory), and it can also be
    used to dynamically filter which trace events to save.
    * Added Processor interface to process (e.g., aggregate information) trace
    events after they have been collected.
    * Fixed compile time errors in the generated tracing code.

2013-09-03  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed code generation regression for the Tracer class - it is now
    generated in the correct package again

2013-09-02  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * The generated methods clone(), copy() and fullCopy() can now be refined.

2013-09-02  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Made aspect "sons" declarations deprecated

2013-08-28  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * JastAdd no longer requires a root node - a non-abstract node that is
    never a child of any other node - in the grammar.

2013-08-27  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved error message for inherited attributes that are missing equations

2013-08-26  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Don't generate the `Tracer` class when the tracing option is absent
    * Don't parse the Tracing class as an aspect

2013-08-24  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added options to change the names of the generated ASTNode, List, and
    Opt types

2013-08-23  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved documentation comment generation
    * Removed some double comment generation
    * Fixed some incorrect generated comment tags
    * Fixed some indentation issues for generated comments
    * JastAdd2 no longer alters modifiers for type declarations by adding
    `public` or removing `static` modifiers
    * It is now possible to use annotations on interface and class declarations

2013-08-22  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed the suppressWarnings option from JastAdd2. JastAdd2 no longer
    attempts to generate SuppressWarnings annotations.
    * Added support for annotations on synthesized attributes (must occur
    before the `syn` or `eq` keywords)
    * Annotations on collection attribute declarations must now be placed before
    the `coll` keyword
    * Annotations on inherited attributes and collection contribution
    equations are still not supported, but no longer cause a generic
    difficult-to-locate syntax error

2013-08-21  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * The Ant build script now compiles to the ant-bin directory in order to
    avoid conflicts with the eclipse project

2013-08-21  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Added flag --lineColumnNumbers that adds methods for storing and
    retrieving line and column numbers (setStart, setEnd, getStartLine,
    getStartColumn, getEndLine, getEndColumn). This flag can be used together
    with the new flag to JastAddParser to remove the dependency to beaver.Symbol

2013-08-20  Görel Hedin <gorel.hedin@cs.lth.se>

    * Added A.hasB() accessor for list children (B is a list child).

2013-08-19  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>
2013-08-21  Görel Hedin <gorel.hedin@cs.lth.se>

    * Added List.AddAll(Collection) to add many objects to a list.

2013-05-31  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed error that could cause fullCopy to initialize NTA children
    with incorrect child indices

2013-05-02  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * The JastAddTask Ant Task now throws a BuildException if JastAdd
    failed to generate an AST instead of silently closing the current JVM

2013-04-26  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added a new List constructor that takes a variable number of children
    and inserts them into the list

2013-04-19  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Added error handling for inherited attributes defined on root nodes
    * Removed flag java14 when JastAdd is built

2013-04-18  Niklas Fors <niklas.fors@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved analysis of equations for inherited attributes

2013-04-12  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Fixed potential null access in generated code
    * Bootstrapped with R20130412

    * New release: 20130412

2013-04-08  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Added entry points that allow custom output/error streams

2013-04-04  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Removed global static variables to allow multiple concurrent JastAdd
    instances in the same JVM

2013-04-03  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Improved error handling for missing equations of synthesized attributes.
    Now only the minimum set of classes requiring an equation is reported.

2013-04-02  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Grammar errors are now gathered using a collection attribute

2013-03-22  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Help text is now printed to standard out (in adherence to the
    GNU Coding Standards for command-line interfaces)

2013-03-19  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * Moved JastAdd main class to the package org.jastadd. A class named
    JastAdd has been left in the package jastadd as a working entry point
    for backward compatibility.
    * Moved the JastAdd Apache Ant task to the package org.jastadd.
    Please use org.jastadd.JastAddTask for future build scripts.

    Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/69

    * Increased minimum (non-empty) child array size from 1 to 4

    * Added init$Children method to initialize the child array with the

2012-11-12  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * New release: 20121112

    * Generate fewer compute methods. Regular non-lazy synthesized
    attributes do not need a separate compute method.
    Fewer compute methods will in general reduce the stack depth

    Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/84
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-10-25:  (JO)

    * Added generated getNumXNoTransform method to count number items
    in list children without triggering rewrites.
    Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/82

    * Fixed static import codegen error.
    Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/83
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-10-19: (JO)

    *  Synthesized attributes with no equation generate an abstract method
    even if another attribute with the same name has an equation in the same
    node type. Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/78

    * Removed the generated attribute for accessing parameterized non-terminal
    value maps due to possible faulty code generation.
    Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/80
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-10-18: (JO)

    * Properly escape backslashes in filenames generated in documentation
    comments. Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/76

    * Do not copy NTA children in fullCopy. Trac ticket:
    http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/77
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-10-11: (GH) New release: 20121011
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-09-18: (JO) all errors, warnings and help messages are printed to stderr
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-09-17: (JO) getChild now returns null if the children array is null
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-06-29: (JO) Add comment to each generated file with the JastAdd2 version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-06-29: (JO) Added low-level attribute to access parameterized
non-terminal value maps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-06-13: (JO) Updated option descriptions.
Updated the descriptions for the defaultMap and defaultSet options.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-05-30: (JO) It is no longer possible to compile inherited equations that
lack a return statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-04-27: (JO) A new class was added to handle command line options passed
to JastAdd. The new jastadd.Option class is responsible for option matching
and help printing. Options can be made deprecated and non-standard.
Only standard, non-deprecated, options are printed in the default help text.
The non-standard options can be printed with the --X option.

Command line options are no longer case sensitive.

If a deprecated option is used JastAdd prints a warning.

If an option is given twice JastAdd prints a warning.

If an unknown option is used (string starting with --) JastAdd prints a
warning.

If an option that requires a value does not have one, JastAdd prints a
warning.

Some option descriptions were slightly modified.

In order to make JastAdd behave the same when invoked from
command line and Ant task, the options --noComponentCheck, --lazyMaps and
--refineLegacy are now default ON. They can be switched off using
--componentCheck, --noLazyMaps and --noRefineLegacy respectively.

Print the error output from the test runner in the ant log rather than sending
it to test_results.

Test runner prints the command used to invoke JastAdd.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-04-26: (JO) Running JastAdd with the --version or --help flags now
makes JastAdd print the requested information and exit with exit code zero.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-04-26: (JO) The Ant build now uses lazyMaps="false" since the lazyMaps
implementation currently causes build errors in some projects. This option
can be re-enabled later when the bug has been fixed properly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-04-24: (JO) Added cast in fullCopy: can't assume that the child
array has type ASTNode[]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-04-23: (JO) Added cast in removeChild: can't assume that the child
array has type ASTNode[]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-04-18: (JO) The pattern matching for the refined keyword is now sensitive
to word boundaries: the substring "refined" is not treated as the refined
keyword if it appears inside e.g. the string "unrefined"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-03-26: (ES) The generated code for syn nta with parameters now allows
null values.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-03-01: (JO) fullCopy now sets the parent of the copied tree to null
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-02-22: (JO) Fixed build errors when invoking the ant script
from another working directory than the project's base directory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012-01-30: (JO) Makefile is now deprecated
-------------------------------------------------------
2012-01-27: (ES) Added a sort of the file list given to
aspectj in Makefile to make sure ast.AST.TokenComponent is
handled before ast.AST.TokenComponentNTA. The order of the
file list apparently affects the result of aspectj 1.5.3
and if not sorted an error will occur. This problem does
not occur when the ant script is run because it the
file list given to aspectj has a different order.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-01-09: (JO) Improved the generated documentation comments
-------------------------------------------------------
2012-01-08: (JO) Removed source file name for constructors,
methods and node types (ASTNode, List, Opt) generated without
an actual source file. This improves the declaredat tag output.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-12-30: (JO) Generate production tags for the RagDoll tool.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-12-30: (JO) Filenames for AST decls is now set
the full path, not the base file name.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-12-01: (JO) Added Apache Ant build script.
Moved version name to resource bundle which is generated
at build time -- this removes the frequent changes in
JastAdd.java due to the version name updating after each
build.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-12-01: (JO) Rewrite debug code escapes file names
in strings. This fixes a bug where JastAdd on Windows
systems could output code that did not compile.
Also added the AspectName token to the Rewrite node type,
so that the actual aspect name could be returned in the
Rewrite.aspectName attribute.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-25: (ES) Moved weaving of interfaces to earlier
Weaving of interfaces after the weaving of attribute/aspect
definitions prevents the second phase to access certain
cached attributes. Attributes that cache their declaration
and which have their declaration in an interface will not
find their declaration until after the interface has been
weaved in. If this attribute is called before this happens
null will be cached eventhough the definition is available
after the interface weaving phase. This causes an error
and prevents generation of Java files.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-24: (ES/JO) Fix of missing "when" problem
There was a bug for contributes classes missing a when
part: an if statement with no condition was generated.
This is now checked in Test119 and a fix is added in
jrag/CollectionAttributes.jrag. The Contribute.getCondition
method probably used to return null but now returns
an empty string when there is no condition. The code
now checks the length of the string in addition to a
null check.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-21: (ES) New bootstrap with nameless Ast aspect
This is basically a revert back to a nameless .ast aspect
which requires less maintenance since there is no aspect
name that may collide with user defined aspect names.
This revert requires a boostrap since it includes an
update of the refines in the jastadd2 code base.
-------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-13: (ES) Update of the first bootstrap step
There was a bug in the generation of visited flags
missed in the last update. The test target of the
Makefile has been updated to prevent this in the future.
It know depends on the "jar" target and not only the
"all" target. Test 117 was added to expose the bug in
the previous bootstrapping attempt.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Update of generated code for java5
There was a name collison when generating java5 code
due to an added method with a generic return type.
The offending method "Iterator ASTDecl.getClassBodyDecls"
was renamed to "Iterator ASTDecl.getClassBodyDeclsItr".
The java5 generated method could have been used with
some adjustments (it generates a list which could be
used to get an iterator) but this would not work for
java1.4 code.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) First bootstrap step
Did a bootstrap with the java1.4 flag on. Updated the
refinement syntax in JragCodeGen.jrag and hand to rename
the "String ASTDecl.flushCollectionCache" to
"String ASTDecl.flushCollectionCacheString" to prevent
a collision with the now generated
"void ASTDecl.flushCollectionCache".
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Added generation of java1.4 code
The previous generation of java1.4 code for circular attributes
resulted in java5 code.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Preparing for boostrap
Changed the Makefile so that jastadd is run with the "--java1.4"
flag to avoid version related compile errors.
Changed the use of "refine" in JragCodeGen.jrag to use
the "refined()" construct instead of the "A.C.m()" construct.
The tests for the latter alternative fails.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Added support for refinement of grammar generated methods
(from .ast) via an "Ast" aspect.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Added tests for refine (110-116)
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-02: (GH) New release: 20110902
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-02: (JO) Changed the name of the RagDoll tag
apilvl to apilevel
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-31: (JO) Added JavaDoc tag output for attributes
and methods.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-31: (JO) Added test target to Makefile.
You can use make test to run all the unit tests and
compare the test results with expected test results.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-10: (JO) Added WINDOWS / CYGWIN notes to README
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-09: (JO) ASTNode Java error fixed
Changed type of node parameter in setChild and insertChild to ASTNode.
This change fixes Java errors that previously were undetected by javac,
but with the latest JDK7 versions from Oracle these errors are reported.
The error was access of childIndex in a context where that field is not
visible.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-06: (GH) Added reference-manual, release-notes, and release script.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-04-25: (GH) Revised tests
Added .info files for test documentation.
RunTests now uses JastAdd2.jar instead of class files.
RunTests now runs JastAdd2.jar as exec process to avoid exit at generation-time errors.
RunTests now accepts tests from 1 to 200.
Added test case Test101.
Refactored some tests to make them succeed under JastAdd2.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-04-06: (GH) Added documentation files in JastAdd2
Added readme, change log file, etc.
Ticket http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/2
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-01-24: (ES) Repository moved
The repo was moved from CVS vitter.cs.lthse to SVN svn.cs.lth.se.
For older change logs, see ChangeLogUntil2010.txt

date: 2010-04-17 13:30:43 +0200;  author: mjolner;  state: Exp;  lines: +1296 -1574;
Fixed bug in ASTNode.fullCopy() when running JastAdd using the j2me option. The init$copy method used to simulate clone was incorrectly implemented, resulting in the original AST being changed and the two copies sharing subtrees. Fixed by changing JastAdd/ast/JaddCodeGen.jrag. (Problem pointed out by Sven Robertz.)/GH
----------------------------
jastadd2.jar revision 1.60

date: 2010-03-10 16:45:57 +0100;  author: mjolner;  state: Exp;  lines: +342 -337;
Fixed bug in ast/ClassRelations.jrag, for attribute fathers(). JastAdd previously treated interast references (using tokens) as children, in some situations. This gave erroneous error messages when using interast references to nodes with inherited attributes. And it led to erroneous constructors for interast references to root nodes. These nodes were erroneously not treated as roots in that they were not set to is$Final upon construction. (Problem pointed out by Philip Nilsson.)/GH
----------------------------
jastadd2.jar revision 1.58
date: 2010-01-29 16:24:00 +0100;  author: mjolner;  state: Exp;  lines: +805 -788;
